High-level approach


Challenges 
I am definitely not familiar with python so had a lot of difficulty coding this. In addition, I struggled to understand the documentation for sockets and just had a terrible time figuring out how it worked. The whole project was just difficult because it was something new and just time consuming.

Guessing strategy
My guessing strategy was just using marks to my advantage. I just used the marks to remove words that could not be possibly the word and then recursively guessed again until it got the word correctly.

Testing
A lot of my testing was using print statements or just running the python file to the server to check for any problems.
